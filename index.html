                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    It was enjoyable to create an app that helps locate musicians because this is a situation I've personally encountered on several occasions being a musician myself. Because of the experiences I've had, I was able to create something easy to use, sleek, and quick that adheres to my knowledge of User Experience Design. When stuck on a problem, I resorted to storyboarding, discovery interviews, and user testing.
                </p>
                <img src="images/sho-photo.png" alt="show photo" class="float-right" />
                <p>
                    Through my studies, I created a solution to the long living problem of finding other musicians to play with. Every iteration has created a stronger product, and every iteration after will continue to strengthen the app.
